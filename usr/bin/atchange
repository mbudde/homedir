#    version = 2.09 of atchange 2006 Mar 22
# 2006 Mar 22, 2.09: Remove the -w to avoid a warning message:
# Use of uninitialized value in numeric eq (==) at [path]atchange line 96.
#
# 2006 Mar 22, 2.08: change first line to #!/usr/bin/env perl -w
#     Formerly it was:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
#     but that only worked on the Sun.  The new version should
#     work on Sun, Linux, Open BSD and Mac OSX.
#     The -w gives warnings, see
#     http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/05/07/mod_perl.html
# 1999 Dec 30, 2.07: functional!

# 1999 Dec 18:  Added shell call to /bin/csh so that
# atchange works under Linux.

# 1999 Feb 5: By setting the PERLCSH variable, the new shell can tell
#             it has been called by atchange.
# The test inside the .cshrc is:
#if ( (! $?PERLCSH ) && $?prompt) then 
#   stty erase '^H'
#   set prompt = "`uname -n` \!% "
#endif
# This is necessary under Sun Solaris 2.6 because otherwise the
# call to stty gives an error message now.

# previous change: 1997 Jan 9
# delay time is 0.25 seconds

# 1999 Dec 30:  James Haefner (jhaefner@biology.usu.edu)
# has found that some changes are needed to make atchange
# work under Linux.  See the web site for details.
# This code will be revised when a good solution is found.

$0 =~ s(.*/)();			# basename
$usage = "usage: $0 filename cmd | $0 command_file";
@ARGV || die $usage;		# check for proper invocation

# This allows the .cshrc to know that atchange has called it:
$ENV{'PERLCSH'} = "TRUE";

# Haefner Suggestion 1999 Dec 18:
##if default SHELL is sh or csh or tcsh use the following line
###$shell = $ENV{"SHELL"} ? $ENV{"SHELL"} : "/bin/sh";
##if default SHELL is bash (eg, Linux) use the following line
# 1999 Dec 28 - this is not a good idea - untestable by me
# $shell = "/bin/csh";
